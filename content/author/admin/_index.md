I am a current student who will finish my MSc Economic degree from University of Nottingham and University of Konstanz in August, 2019. From September, I will go to University College Dublin to pursue my degree in Mathematics.

On this website, you can find my notes and code on different economic and mathematic subjects. My main research interests lie in Game Theory, Macroeconomics, Applied Mathematics. You can find my [cv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WhOvWAJ1tvp5fkU2K1AjceaCeFN5HqFY/view) (Michael is my English name).
